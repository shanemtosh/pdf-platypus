# Contributing to PDF Platypus

We welcome contributions to PDF Platypus. To maintain the quality and integrity of the codebase, please adhere to the following standards.

## Code Standards

1. No Emojis
Never use emojis in code, comments, UI strings, documentation, or commit messages.

2. Strict Type Safety
Do not use the "any" type. Use proper TypeScript interfaces and types for all variables, functions, and components.

3. Clean and Intentional Code
- Avoid comments that explain obvious code.
- Remove dead code or commented-out code blocks.
- Ensure consistent formatting and indentation.
- Maintain the "Zero Data Retention" principle: all processing must happen client-side.

## Development Process

2. Create a feature branch for your changes.
3. Ensure the project builds successfully with "npm run build".
